<h4>1.5.1.1.3. Computers on the Basis of Hardware Design and Data Handling.</h4>

<h5>1.5.1.1.3.1. Analog Computer</h5><img src="images/analog-computer.jpg" align="right" width="350" height="350">

An analog computer performs tasks using continuous data (the physical amount that changes continuously). Analog computers are used primarily to measure physical units like voltage, pressure, electric current, temperature, and convert them into digits.
It is also used to measure and perform arithmetic calculations of numbers, the length of an object, or the amount of voltage that passes through a point in an electrical circuit. Analog computers obtain all their data from some measurement way.
Analog computers are mainly used in the fields of science and engineering. Analog computers are slow and equipped to measure things rather than countable or check.
The efficiency of this computer increases when we get the result of the data in graphs, etc. Analog Computers cannot store statistics.

They are used in the fields of technology, science, research, engineering, education, etc. Because quantities like the voltage, pressure, electric current, temperature are used more in these areas, these types of computers give only approximate estimates.

Examples:
An analog computer installed on a petrol pump measures the amount of petrol coming out of the pump and appears in liters. And calculates its value. These quantities vary continuously while measuring the amount, such as the temperature of a human body changes consistently.
A simple clock, the vehicle’s speedometer, Voltmeter, etc. are examples of analog computing.

<h5>1.5.1.1.3.2. Digital Computer</h5><img src="images/Digital.jpg" align="right" width="350" height="350">

As its name suggests, a digital computer represents the digital computer’s letters, numerical values, or any other special symbols. This computer is the computer that calculates the number for processing the data.
They run on electronic signs, and the binary numeral method Binary System 0 or 1 is used for calculation. Their speed is fast.
It can perform arithmetic operations such as addition, occurrence, subtraction, multiplication, or division and all types of logical(mathematical) operations. Today, most of the computers available in the market are digital computers.
Digital computers are built to bring the solution of equations to an almost unlimited precision, but in a bit slow manner compared to analog computers. To some extent, they all have similar components for receiving, processing, sorting, and transmitting data and use a relatively small number of essential functions to perform their tasks.
Digital computers use discrete electrical signals for operation rather than continuous electrical signals as analog computers have, making the most common form of computers today because of their versatility, speed, and power.

The desktop or Laptop at our home is one the common and best example of a digital computer.

<h5>1.5.1.1.3.3. Hybrid Computer</h5>

A hybrid computer is a combined complex computer unit built using both analog and digital properties and united by a single control system. The purpose of designing hybrid computers is to provide functions and features that can be found on both analog and digital devices.
The aim behind creating a hybrid computer is to create a kind of work unit that offers the best of both types of computers. Hybrid computers are extremely fast when driving equations, even when those calculations are incredibly complex.<img src="images/Hybrid Computer.jpg" align="right" width="350" height="350" alt="Ultrasound Machine">

As both the properties of a computer consist in the form of a single hybrid computer made possible to solve too complex calculations or problems, at the same time, these devices are not only too expensive but also able to solve complex issues bit fast.
Incorporating the properties of both (analog and digital) computers into hybrid computers makes it possible to resolve more difficult equations immediately.
The analog computer systems solve the equation process immediately. But it is not necessary that those solutions would be completely accurate.
Here, the digital computer system gives 100 % percent correct solutions, but it takes a bit of time in the calculation. Therefore, Hybrid computers are made to overcome the flaws of both these analog and digital systems.

Applications of hybrid Computer:
Hybrid computers are most commonly used in vast industries, research centers, organizations, and manufacturing firms (where many equations need to be solved).
Also, the solutions and uses of hybrid computers have proved to be much more detailed, accurate, and useful. Hybrid computers are used in scientific calculations, for nations’ defense and radar systems as well.

Examples:  Hycomp 250, released by Packard Bell in 1961, the HYDAC 2400, an integrated hybrid computer released by EAI in 1963, etc.
